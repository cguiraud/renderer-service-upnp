* Logging mechanism (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

  renderer-service-upnp is badly in need of a logging mechanism that
  can be switched on and off.


* Remove request bottleneck (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 All requests from all clients are placed in a queue upon reception
 and their execution is serialized.  This was done initially to keep
 things simple and easy to debug but it introduces an unnecessary
 bottleneck which could become apparent when there are multiple
 clients.  This is unfortunate as the whole raison d'etre for
 renderer-service UPNP is to efficiently support multiple control
 points.

 For example let's suppose client 1 sends a request to server 1 and
 client 2 sends a request to server 2.  Under the current
 implementation client 2's request is not sent to server 2 until
 client 1's request has completed.  This delay is unnecessary as
 client 2's request can be sent before client 1's has completed,
 without causing any problems.  How best to resolve this situation has
 yet to be determined.  We could have a separate queue for each server
 or simply no queues at all as servers should be able to handle
 multiple simultaneous requests from the same control point.  Perhaps
 both configurations might be possible.  The former may prove to be
 useful in debugging.


* Implement org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Playlists (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012


* Implement org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.TrackList (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012


* Generate signals when a property changes (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 Currently no signal is generated when a renderer property changes.  This
 is unfortunate as it prevents Digital Media Controllers from correctly
 updating their user interfaces.  The code needs to be modified to issue
 the org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal when properties
 change.


* Implement the Volume property (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012


* Allow properties to be modified (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 Most of the MPRIS properties are read only.  Some however, such as
 Rate and Volume can be modified by clients.  Currently, however, all
 properties in renderer-service-upnp are read only.


* Add DLNA headers to hosted files (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 DLNA headers need to be added to files hosted by renderer-service-upnp.
 I'm think specifically of contentFeatures.dlna.org here.


* System Bus (Mark Ryan) 26/04/2012

 Is the session bus the right bus for us?
