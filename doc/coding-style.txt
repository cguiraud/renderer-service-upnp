Coding Style
--------------

Renderer-service-upnp uses the linux kernel coding standard (1), with
some exceptions and additions.  The linux kernel coding standard needs
to be read in addition to this document before code can be submitted
to renderer-service-upnp.  There is one exception to the linux coding
standard permitted by renderer-service-upnp; typedefs are used for
structures, for example

    typedef struct rsu_buf_t_ rsu_buf_t;
    struct rsu_buf_t_ {
        unsigned int size;
        unsigned int max_size;
        unsigned int block_size;
        uint8_t *buffer;
   };

We also have a number of additions to the linux coding guidelines,
each of which will be described in its own section.

Naming
-------

All identifiers, be they labels, function names, types or variables
should be in lower case. Underscores '_', should be used to separate
the different words that compose multi-word identifiers, e.g.,
do_something.

Identifiers that are accessible outside the file in which they are
defined should be prefixed by rsu_ or RSU_ depending on whether they
are types, functions and variables or macros.

The names of any new types defined should end in _t.

Functions that are private to a given file should be static and their
names should be prefixed with prv_, e.g., prv_open_file.

The names of functions that are accessible outside a file and are
essentially methods that operate on a structure should be prefixed by
the name of the structure, in addition to rsu_.  Therefore a function
that creates a pointer array might be called rsu_pointer_array_create.

Parameters
-----------

Function parameters should not be prefixed with any identifiers that
indicate whether they are input or output parameters.

Input parameters should appear at the beginning of the parameter list.

Output parameters should appear at the end of the argument list. The
first parameter of a method that operates on an existing structure
instance should be a pointer to that structure instance. An exception
here are constructor functions, where the created structure instance
will be passed out of the constructor using the final output parameter
of the parameter list. Here are some examples,

    void rsu_file_new(const char *fname, map_file_t **map_file);
    const char *rsu_file_search(map_file_t *map_file,
                                const char *key);

Errors
-----------

In all but the most simple functions errors should be handled using
gotos.  For example;

    int fn()
    {
        if (!fn1())
            goto on_error;

        if (!fn2())
            goto on_error;

     on_error:

        return err;
    }


The label on_error should be used as the label to jump to in
case of error.  You are free to define additional labels using your own
naming scheme if necessary, e.g., no_free.

Functions
-------------

Functions should only have one exit point.  Multiple exit points typically
lead to memory leaks and other errors.  Multiple return statements are
permitted in one case only and this is when both return statements appear at
the bottom of the function on either sides of an error label.  Sometimes
this is useful to avoid having to set local variables whose ownership is
being transferred to the caller to NULL, e.g.,

    gboolean fn(char **name)
    {
        char *str;

        str = strdup("Hello");
        if (!str)
            goto on_error;

        ok = fn1(str);
        if (!ok)
            goto on_error;

        *name = str;

        return TRUE;

 on_error:

         free(str);

         return FALSE;
}

Header Files:
-------------

Should include header guards whose names should be in uppercase and derived
from the project name, e.g., RSU_, and the file name.  The
guard names should be followed by an underscore, e.g.,


    #ifndef RSU_UTILS_H__
    #define RSU_UTILS_H__

config.h should never be included in a header file as it does not
contain any header guards.

Local Variables:
----------------

Local variables should all be declared at the top of the function.
This is enforced by compiler options.


Global Variables:
-----------------

Modifiable global variables should be avoided where possible. Constant global
variables are permitted. The names of global variables should be begin with
g_, i.e., g_token_dictionary.

Git Usage:
-----------

We will try to maintain a single branch in our git repository.  Please rebase
your changes before submitting patches.

Do not submit multiple features or bugs fixes in the same patch.  Split your
changes into separate smaller patches.
